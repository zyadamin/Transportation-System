# Transportation-System
The term “transportation system” is used to refer to the equipment and logistics of
transporting passengers and goods. It covers movement by all forms of transport, from
cars, bikes, scooters and buses to boats, aircraft and even space travel. The purpose of
a transportation system is to coordinate the movement of people, goods and vehicles in
order to utilize routes most efficiently. When implemented, transportation systems seek
to reduce transport costs and improve delivery times through effective timetabling and
route management. Periodic re-evaluations and the development of alternative routes
allow for timely changes to the transportation system in order to maintain efficiency.
A transportation system can include the following functionalities:
1. Signing up a new user.
2. Updating a user details.
3. Provide driver details.
4. Adding/updating ways of a ride payment (Cash / Visa / MasterCard).
5. Showing a list of vehicle types (e.g. bus/car/scooter).
6. Provide trip details (driver name, license plate no, car type, contact number,
ride time, ride fees, …).
7. Provide ride ratings (Allow feedbacks).
8. Provide ride history (All the rides for a certain user).
9. Allow to enter promo codes.
10. Provide booking service for the ride.
